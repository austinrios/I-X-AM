	<h1>Welcome TO I X AM!</h1>
		<h2>Our mission:</h2>
		<h6>Here at I X AM the mission has always been to aid in the curing of
				preventable blindness by providing easily accessible near visual accuity
				exams.</h6>
		
		<h2>What does the app do?</h2>
		<h6>I X AM was developed using swift and Xcode. The steps in our methodology are as follows<h6>
		<ol>
			<li>The user first must answer the opening questions of their gender, height, and age.</li>
			<li>The user is then asked to hold their phone as far away from them as their arms will allow</li>
			<li>Once these steps are completed the application will then begin going through the test</li>
			<li>On the user’s phone they will see the first letter of the first line</li>
			<li>Just like in a real eye exam the user will be prompted to say aloud the
			letter that they see, the phone will check to see if the letter said matches 
			the letter shown</li>
			<li>If the user answers correctly the application will continue onto the next line</li>
			<li>As the user continues to take the exam, the application will move to progressively
			smaller lines until the test is over or until the user gets at least have of the line wrong</li>
			<li>With some knowledge of proportions anyone could then figure out the adjusted score however
			the application handles that itself and produces the user’s results for them</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Results</h2>

		<h3>The following are things that we were able to accomplish</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The calculations of someone's eye exam score(20/0, 20/30, etc)</li>
				<li>The successful randomization of different eye charts</li>
				<li>Successful movement between the different storyboards</li>
				<li>Launching on multiple different IOS devices</li>
				<li>Providing the user an alternative to a standard eye exam</li>
			</ul>
